<td colspan="3"><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF; IAST: Bh훮rat카ya V훮yu Sen훮) is the air arm of the Indian armed forces. Its complement of personnel and aircraft assets ranks fourth amongst the airforces of the world.Its primary mission is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Empire which honored India's aviation service during World War II with the prefix Royal.</p><p>The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF.The Chief of Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002 Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.</p></td>

<td colspan="3"><p>The Indian Air Force was established on 8 October 1932 in British India as an auxiliary air force of the Royal Air Force. The enactment of the Indian Air Force Act 1932 stipulated out their auxiliary status and enforced the adoption of the Royal Air Force uniforms, badges, brevets and insignia.</p><p> On 1 April 1933, the IAF commissioned its first squadron, No.1 Squadron, with four Westland Wapiti biplanes and five Indian pilots. The Indian pilots were led by British RAF Commanding officer Flight Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) Cecil Bouchier.</p></td>

<table>
<tr>
<td colspace="3"><p>The Indian Air Force is divided into five operational and two functional commands. Each Command is headed by an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Air Marshal. The purpose of an operational command is to conduct military operations using aircraft within its area of responsibility, whereas the responsibility of functional commands is to maintain combat readiness. Aside from the Training Command at Bangalore, the primary flight training is done at the Air Force Academy, Dundigul (located in Hyderabad), followed by operational training at various other schools.</p> <p> Advanced officer training for command positions is also conducted at the Defence Services Staff College; specialised advanced flight training schools are located at Bidar, Karnataka and Hakimpet, Telangana (also the location for helicopter training). Technical schools are found at a number of other locations.</p></td>

<ul>
<li><font size="4" color="blue"><u>Operational commands:</u></font>
<ul>
<li>Central Air Command (CAC), headquartered at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh</li>
<li>Eastern Air Command (EAC), headquartered at Shillong, Meghalaya</li>
<li>Southern Air Command (SAC), headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala</li>
<li>South Western Air Command (SWAC), headquartered at Gandhinagar, Gujara</li>
<li>Western Air Command (WAC), headquartered at New Delhi</li>

<li>Maintenance Command (MC), headquartered at Nagpur, Maharashtra</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font size="4" color="blue"><u>Wings:</u></font>
<ul>
<li>A wing is a formation intermediate between a command and a squadron. It generally consists of two or three IAF squadrons and helicopter units, along with forward base support units (FBSU). FBSUs do not have or host any squadrons or helicopter units but act as transit airbases for routine operations. In times of war, they can become fully fledged air bases playing host to various squadrons. In all, about 47 wings and 19 FBSUs make up the IAF.[100][101] Wings are typically commanded by a group captain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font size="4" color="blue"><u>Squadrons and units:</u></font>
<ul>
<li>Squadrons are the field units and formations attached to static locations. Thus, a flying squadron or unit is a sub-unit of an air force station which carries out the primary task of the IAF. A fighter squadron consists of 18 aircraft; all fighter squadrons are headed by a commanding officer with the rank of wing commander.Some transport squadrons and helicopter units are headed by a commanding officer with the rank of group captain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font size="4" color="blue"><u>Flights:</u></font>
<ul>
<li>Flights are sub-divisions of squadrons, commanded by a squadron leader. Each flight consists of two sections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font size="4" color="blue"><u>Sections:</u></font>
<ul>
<li>The smallest unit is the section, led by a flight lieutenant. Each section consists of three aircraft.</li>
<li>Within this formation structure, IAF has several service branches for day-to-day operations. They are:
<ol type="i">
<li>Flying Branch</li>
<li>Technical Branch</li>
<li>Ground Branch</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font size="4" color="blue"><u>Integrated Space Cell:</u></font>
<ul>
<li>An Integrated Space Cell, which will be jointly operated by all the three services of the Indian armed forces, the civilian Department of Space and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has been set up to utilise more effectively the country's space-based assets for military purposes.</li>
<li>This command will leverage space technology including satellites. Unlike an aerospace command, where the air force controls most of its activities, the Integrated Space Cell envisages co-operation and co-ordination between the three services as well as civilian agencies dealing with space.</li>

<td colspan="3"><p>The number of aircraft in the IAF has been decreasing from the late 1990s due to retirement of older aircraft and several crashes. To deal with the depletion of force levels, the IAF has started to modernise its fleet. This includes both the upgrade of existing aircraft, equipment and infrastructure as well as induction of new aircraft and equipment, both indigenous and imported. As new aircraft enter service and numbers recover, the IAF plans to have a fleet of 42 squadrons.</p></td>

<ul>
<li>Single Engined Fighters:
<ul>
<li>On 3 January 2017, Minister of Defence Manohar Parrikar addressed a media conference and announced plans for a competition to select a Strategic Partner to deliver "... 200 new single engine fighters to be made in India, which will easily cost around (USD)$45 million apiece without weaponry" with an expectation that Lockheed Martin (USA) and Saab (Sweden) will pitch the F-16 Block 70 and Gripen, respectively.</li>
<li> An MoD official said that a global tender will be put to market in the first quarter of 2018, with a private company nominated as the strategic partners production agency followed by a two or more year process to evaluate technical and financial bids and conduct trials, before the final government-to-government deal in 2021. This represents 11 squadrons of aircraft plus several 'attrition' aircraft</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current acquisitions:
<ul>
<li>The IAF has placed orders for 120 HAL Tejas fighters, 36 Dassault Rafale multi-role fighters,112 Pilatus PC-7MkII basic trainers, 72 HAL HJT-36 Sitara trainers, 72 Pipistrel Virus SW 80 microlight aircraft, 10 C-17 Globemaster III strategic air-lifters, 65 HAL Light Combat Helicopters, 139 Mi-17V-5 helicopters.</li>
<li>The IAF has issued a Request for Information (RFI) for 16 C-27J Spartan medium military transport aircraft. A new Request For Information has been issued to replace Hawker Siddeley HS 748 for $2.4 billion. The IAF also submitted a request for information to international suppliers for a stealth unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Network-centric warfare:
<ul>
<li>The Air Force Network (AFNET), a robust digital information grid that enabled quick and accurate threat responses, was launched in 2010, helping the IAF become a truly network-centric air force. AFNET is a secure communication network linking command and control centres with offensive aircraft, sensor platforms and ground missile batteries.</li>
<li> Integrated Air Command and Control System (IACCS), an automated system for Air Defence operations will ride the AFNet backbone integrating ground and airborne sensors, weapon systems and command and control nodes. </li>
<li>Subsequent integration with civil radar and other networks shall provide an integrated Air Situation Picture, and reportedly acts as a force multiplier for intelligence analysis, mission control, and support activities like maintenance and logistics.</li>
<li> The design features multiple layers of security measures, including encryption and intrusion prevention technologies, to hinder and deter espionage efforts</li>
</ul>
